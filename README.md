# CloudFormation ECS Task Runner Custom Resource

This repository defines the Lamdba function `cfnEcsTasks`.  

This function is a CloudFormation custom resource that runs ECS tasks and polls the task until successful completion or failure.  The function will report both ECS task failures and any task that exits with a non-zero code as a failure.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 

## Build Instructions

Any dependencies need to defined in `src/requirements.txt`.  Note that you do not need to include `boto3`, as this is provided by AWS for Python Lambda functions.

To build the function and its dependencies:

`make build`

This will create the necessary dependencies in the `src` folder and create a ZIP package in the `build` folder.  This file is suitable for upload to the AWS Lambda service to create a Lambda function.

```
$ make build
=> Building cfnEcsTasks.zip...
Collecting cfn_lambda_handler (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
Installing collected packages: cfn-lambda-handler

```

### Function Naming

The default name for this function is `cfnEcsTasks` and the corresponding ZIP package that is generated is called `cfnEcsTasks.zip`.

If you want to change the function name, you can either update the `FUNCTION_NAME` setting in the `Makefile` or alternatively configure an environment variable of the same name to override the default function name.

## Publishing the Function

When you publish the function, you are simply copying the built ZIP package to an S3 bucket.  Before you can do this, you must ensure you have created the S3 bucket and your environment is configured correctly with appropriate AWS credentials and/or profiles.

To specify the S3 bucket that the function should be published to, you can either configure the `S3_BUCKET` setting in the `Makefile` or alternatively configure an environment variable of the same name to override the default S3 bucket name.

> [Versioning](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html) should be enabled on the S3 bucket

To deploy the built ZIP package:

`make publish`

This will upload the built ZIP package to the configured S3 bucket.

> When a new or updated package is published, the S3 object version will be displayed.

### Publish Example

```
$ make publish
...
...
=> Built build/cfnEcsTasks.zip
=> Publishing cfnEcsTasks.zip to s3://429614120872-cfn-lambda...
=> Published to S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/429614120872-cfn-lambda/cfnEcsTasks.zip
=> S3 Object Version: gyujkgVKoH.NVeeuLYTi_7n_NUburwa4
```

## CloudFormation Usage

This function is designed to be called from a CloudFormation template as a custom resource.

In general you should create a Lambda function per CloudFormation stack and then create custom resources that call the Lambda function.

### Defining the Lambda Function

The following CloudFormation template snippet demonstrates creating the Lambda function, along with supporting CloudWatch Logs and IAM role resources:

> Note this snippet assumes you have an ECS Cluster resource called `ApplicationCluster`, which is used to constrain the IAM privileges assigned to the Lambda function.

### Creating Custom Resources that use the Lambda Function

The following custom resource calls the `EcsTaskRunner` Lambda function when the resource is created, updated or deleted:

```
  MigrateTask:
    Type: "Custom::ECSTask"
    Properties:
      ServiceToken:
        Fn::Sub: "${EcsTaskRunner.Arn}"
      Cluster: { "Ref": "ApplicationCluster" }
      TaskDefinition: { "Ref": "ApplicationTaskDefinition" }
      Count: 1              
      Timeout: 1800           # The maximum amount of time to wait for the task to complete - defaults to 290 seconds
      RunOnUpdate: True       # Controls if the task should run for update operations - defaults to True
      UpdateCriteria:         # Specifies criteria to determine if a task update should run
        - Container: app
          EnvironmentKeys:    # List of environment keys to compare.  The task is only run if the environment key value has changed.
            - DB_HOST
      PollInterval: 30        # How often to poll the status of a given task
      Overrides:              # Task definition overrides
        containerOverrides:
          - name: app
            command:
              - bundle
              - exec
              - rake
              - db:migrate
            environment:
